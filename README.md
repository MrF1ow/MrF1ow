# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ #

## ðŸš€ About Me ##

ðŸŽ“ I am Ethan Flow, an upcoming **Full Stack Developer** with a focus in **Cloud Development**, pursuing my Bachelors in **Computer Science & Engineering** from Oregon State University.

ðŸ“– I am really enthusiastic about learning new technologies. In 2022, I learned JavaScript, React, and Node.js. In 2022 until now, I learnt C++/C and Python.

ðŸŽ¸ Outside the world of tech I love pushing myself to develop new skills ranging **car mechanics**, **dancing**, and **guitar**.

ðŸ“š A new found love of mine has been reading books about **financial literacy** and listening to podcasts related to **entrepreneurship** and **personal developement**. 

ðŸ“… Looking into the future, I am going to solidify my abilities with React and Node.js, while transitioning over to TypeScript. On top of this I am going to take Google's Free AI courses released with their new Gemini announcement.
